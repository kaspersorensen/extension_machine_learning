Things that will need to be improved for it to be a somewhat useful MVP:

[x] Transformers to relativize and scale numbers (features) between 0 and 1
[x] Category/ordinal value feature generator
[x] N-gram feature generator
[ ] Add a "max n-grams" and "max hot-one values" parameter
[ ] Add icons
[x] Make the UI hide inappropriate/impossible FeatureModifierType mappings
